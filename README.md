## Overview

- The optimisation of personnel management in today's dynamic organisations depends on the seamless integration of technology. This study presents a novel face recognition system that redefines employee authentication, job distribution, and attendance tracking. It is enhanced by the Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) method. Using a strong SQLite3 database and the power of Â Python, our system guarantees unmatched facial recognition accuracy while also giving HR managers and department heads deep insights into their workforce dynamics.
